        <p>I am working as a front-end performance engineer at Pitch.</p>

        <p>
          I believe as long as work is a big part of my life, it must be
          amusing. I am fond of solving complex and non-trivial problems.
          Working together with a strong team and making meaningful
          contributions to a project motivates me better than anything else.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm not looking for a job right now, but here you can find some
          information about me and my projects.
        </p>

        <p>Don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
