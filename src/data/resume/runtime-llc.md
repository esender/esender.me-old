Runtime is a company with various internal products, one of them is a wholesale platform.

Mainly I worked for a single project, a wholesale platform called SitePokupok, which involved implementing new features from scratch using ReactJS, covering codebase with tests, setting up a front-end development environment and mentoring junior FE engineers. My role also included assisting in a small way with other projects, performing bug fixes and front-end development consultations.
