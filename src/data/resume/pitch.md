Pitch is the modern presentation software built for teams.

Performance is an important direction of work in Pitch. As the performance team, we are working on different parts of the system, carry out investigations, and finding out what we can do for a better user experience in the performance way. We share our knowledge with other teams and help them improve their codebase as well.
